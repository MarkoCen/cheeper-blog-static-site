<a id="more"></a>
<h4 id="Apple-iPhone-8-8S"><a href="#Apple-iPhone-8-8S" class="headerlink" title="Apple iPhone 8/8S"></a><strong>Apple iPhone 8/8S</strong></h4><p><img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/MarkoCen/cheeper-images/12617373/apple-iphone-8.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The year of 2017 is the ten anniversary of Apple’s iPhone, the outside world agreed that Apple will make the largest upgrading for iPhone in its history. The next version of iPhone may be called <a href="http://amzn.to/2jiMHIJ" target="_blank" rel="external">iPhone 8/8s</a>, but it is also possible to use a new version name. the upgrade may include the use of new glass shell appearance, AMOLED hyperboloid screen, wireless charging, super dual camera and so on. There is a little chance that Apple may also release <a href="http://amzn.to/2jVaXTd" target="_blank" rel="external">iPhone 7S</a> in 2017, but based on past experiences, Apple won’t release two flagship phones at same year.</p>
<h4 id="Samsung-Galaxy-S8-S8-Edge-Note-8"><a href="#Samsung-Galaxy-S8-S8-Edge-Note-8" class="headerlink" title="Samsung Galaxy S8/S8 Edge/Note 8"></a><strong>Samsung Galaxy S8/S8 Edge/Note 8</strong></h4><p><img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/MarkoCen/cheeper-images/12617373/galaxy-s8.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The era of smartphone technology creators have long been more than just Apple, Samsung’s hyperbolic screen is the most successful invention in 2016, at the same time, Samsung is also taking the lead of camera technology in the entire smartphone industry. </p>
<p>Due to the current Samsung phones still not use dual camera, and the industry which either Apple or various international and domestic manufacturers have taken the dual camera, so it is worth to look forward the <a href="http://amzn.to/2k4I20Q" target="_blank" rel="external">new Galaxy phones</a> integrate dual camera, in addition, because of the obvious problems of <a href="http://amzn.to/2jtotyy" target="_blank" rel="external">Note 7</a>, the S Pen and iris recognition features has also been delayed, and those features may add into the new Note 8.</p>
<h4 id="Huawei-P10-Mate-10"><a href="#Huawei-P10-Mate-10" class="headerlink" title="Huawei P10/Mate 10"></a><strong>Huawei P10/Mate 10</strong></h4><p><img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/MarkoCen/cheeper-images/12617373/huawei-10.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>2016 is a successful year for <a href="http://amzn.to/2k7ldu2" target="_blank" rel="external">Huawei P9</a> and <a href="http://amzn.to/2jUZLWx" target="_blank" rel="external">Mate 9</a>, the best selling point is Leica’s dual camera. In 2017, beside dual camera, Huawei P10/Mate 10 would also integrate hyperbolic screen and ultrasonic fingerprint identification technology, and <a href="http://amzn.to/2jVbJzB" target="_blank" rel="external">P10/Mate 10</a> would use most recent release Kirin 970 CPU. Last year, Mate 9 also launched a special version of cooperation with Porsche, Mate 10 is expected to continue this strategy.</p>
<h4 id="ASUS-ZenFone-AR"><a href="#ASUS-ZenFone-AR" class="headerlink" title="ASUS ZenFone AR"></a><strong>ASUS ZenFone AR</strong></h4><p><img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/MarkoCen/cheeper-images/12617373/asus-phone.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The quality of <a href="http://amzn.to/2j8oklV" target="_blank" rel="external">ASUS ZenFone seriers</a> has been well recognized, every year ASUS will also launch new models with numerous new characteristics, last year, ASUS has a very good cooperation relationship with Qualcomm, this year ZenFone AR would also be built with SnapDragon 835 CPU. On this year’s CES, ASUS first introduced ZenFone AR, from their poster, ZenFone AR would support dual camera and AR (the second phone in the world to support Google Tango).</p>
<h4 id="OnePlus-4"><a href="#OnePlus-4" class="headerlink" title="OnePlus 4"></a><strong>OnePlus 4</strong></h4><p><img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/MarkoCen/cheeper-images/12617373/oneplus-4.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2jtEGnB" target="_blank" rel="external">OnePlus phones</a> has been well-known by the high performance and low-cost, the 2017 flagship OnePlus 4 may be equipped with the latest Qualcomm SnapDragon 835 CPU and 8G memory, and the price may lower than $500.  </p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://amzn.to/2ks4n9Q" target="_blank" rel="external">Dell XPS 15</a> and the <a href="http://amzn.to/2k2GrZP" target="_blank" rel="external">MacBook Pro</a> are both excellent computers. It often is said that the two are so close in terms of quality that it’s difficult to say which is better. However, they each have their own benefits and drawbacks.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-MLW72LL-15-4-inch-quad-core/dp/B01LTHXAO0/ref=as_li_ss_il?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1485331496&sr=1-1&keywords=macbook+pro&linkCode=li3&tag=cheeperio-20&linkId=02d383b5eb461c054eacb5aa16467d0a" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B01LTHXAO0&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=cheeperio-20"></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=cheeperio-20&l=li3&o=1&a=B01LTHXAO0" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;"></p>
<h4 id="Pros-Of-The-MacBook-Pro"><a href="#Pros-Of-The-MacBook-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Pros Of The MacBook Pro"></a><strong>Pros Of The MacBook Pro</strong></h4><ul>
<li><p>MacBook Pro Security: The MacBook Pro uses a Mac Sierra operating system, which tends to be more secure than the Windows 10 used by the Dell XPS15. While macintosh operating systems are not completely immune to malware, they are far more malware resistant than Windows. </p>
</li>
<li><p>The MacBook Pro’s Built In Voice Assistant: The MacBook Pro comes with Siri. While the Dell XPS15 offers Cortana, Siri is much more reliable. Additionally, Siri does not track your voice search history like Cortana. Your voice searches with Siri aren’t saved with your IP address, name, or any personally identifying information. </p>
</li>
<li><p>The Touch Screen: The MacBook Pro touch screen is one of the best on the market. Many have said that the experience of using the MacBook Pro is like combining an iPhone with a laptop. Despite there being a touchscreen, there also is a quality keyboard to use. While it’s possible to get a touchscreen on a Dell XPS 15, the MacBook Pro is of better quality. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Cons-Of-The-MacBook-Pro"><a href="#Cons-Of-The-MacBook-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Cons Of The MacBook Pro"></a><strong>Cons Of The MacBook Pro</strong></h4><ul>
<li><p>Less Ports: The MacBook Pro doesn’t have anywhere near the number of ports as the Dell XPS 15. This means that it’s not as easy to connect other devices to it. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Price: The MacBook Pro will cost you at least $1499 from Apple. If you get the touchscreen, the price rises to $1999. You could <a href="https://cheeper.io">check &amp; compare Macbook Pro prices here</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A Small Number Of Games Available: There are relatively few games run on a Mac Sierra operating system. While there are some, you’re likely to have a much harder time finding a game that you like.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dell-XPS9560-5000SLV-PUS-15-6-Inch-Traditional-Laptop/dp/B01N2RLP5M/ref=as_li_ss_il?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1485347011&sr=1-3&keywords=dell+xps+15&linkCode=li3&tag=cheeperio-20&linkId=9f62654180079b416aa58503d36e1a58" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B01N2RLP5M&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=cheeperio-20"></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=cheeperio-20&l=li3&o=1&a=B01N2RLP5M" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;"></p>
<h4 id="Pros-Of-Dell-XPS-15"><a href="#Pros-Of-Dell-XPS-15" class="headerlink" title="Pros Of Dell XPS 15"></a><strong>Pros Of Dell XPS 15</strong></h4><ul>
<li><p>Quality Gaming Experience: If you’re a fan of PC games, you’ll definitely want a Windows operating system. The Dell XPS 15 comes with Windows 10. This operating system will allow you to play an exceptionally wide range of games, and you’ll be able to stream games from your <a href="http://amzn.to/2jedkON" target="_blank" rel="external">Xbox One</a> or <a href="http://amzn.to/2ksgrI1" target="_blank" rel="external">PlayStation 4</a> to your laptop! There are even some Windows 10 games available for free. </p>
</li>
<li><p>It’s Environmentally Friendly: The Dell XPS 15 is particularly environmentally friendly. Many computers have toxic metals inside them, but the Dell XPS 15 is designed without mercury and other toxic metals.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Battery Life: The Dell XPS 15 potentially can have a somewhat longer battery life than the MacBook Pro. The MacBook Pro has a battery that holds 49.2 watt hours, but the Dell XPS 15 has a battery that holds 60 watt hours. The difference is not that large, but it can make a difference. However, this advantage is eliminated if you get the Dell XPS 15 with a touchscreen. If you get a touchscreen, the battery tends not to last as long as the MacBook Pro. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Higher Resolution: The Dell XPS 15 features excellent graphics. In fact, the resolution on the Dell XPS 15 is 3200 x 1800 pixels as opposed to the MacBook Pro’s 2,560 x 1,600 pixels. It even is possible to pay extra to get the Dell XPS 15 with QHD+. This will result in even better graphics </p>
</li>
<li><p>More Advanced Processor: The processor on the Dell XPS 15 uses a 7th Generation Intel Core processor. However, the MacBook Pro runs on a 6th Generation Intel Core Processor. </p>
</li>
<li><p>High Resolution Webcam: The Dell XPS 15 has a higher resolution webcam than the MacBook Pro. The webcam on the Dell XPS 15 has a resolution of 720p. This is far more than the MacBook Pro’s webcam resolution of 480p. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Cons-Of-The-Dell-XPS-15"><a href="#Cons-Of-The-Dell-XPS-15" class="headerlink" title="Cons Of The Dell XPS 15"></a><strong>Cons Of The Dell XPS 15</strong></h4><ul>
<li><p>Inaccurate Colors On The Webcam: The Dell XPS 15 webcam doesn’t show colors as they are. Instead, the colors tend to be a bit over-saturated.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Lower Quality Audio: While the graphics on the Dell XPS 15 are excellent, the audio isn’t anywhere near this level of quality. However, the MacBook Pro offers higher quality audio. If you listen to music a lot, this can be a reason to choose the MacBook Pro over the Dell XPS 15. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Lower Hard Drive Speed: Copying and moving files can take longer with the Dell XPS 15 than the MacBook Pro. The hard drive tends to run substantially slower. On the MacBook Pro, the hard drive speed averages 355.9 mb/s. However, the hard drive on the Dell XPS 15 averages at just 231.33 mb/s. This figure is even slower if you use a Dell XPS 15 with a touchscreen.</p>

<a id="more"></a>
<p>However, all this eventually become memories - Google decided <a href="http://www.androidcentral.com/end-nexus-2016-google-phones-forge-new-path" target="_blank" rel="external">end the Nexus series on 2016</a>, and created new signature series and named it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Pixel" target="_blank" rel="external">Pixel</a>.</p>
<p>Prior to the Nexus phone has been the foundry to provide design solutions, Google is responsible for changes and additions, so we can find the Nexus phone on behalf of the various foundries.<br>This year’s Pixel mobile phone designed entirely by Google itself, on behalf of the industry is only responsible for the production and assembly of HTC, which is very similar to the relationship between Apple and Foxconn. This time you can only find one capital “G” on the back of pixel phone, and no traces of the foundry, which also marks Google officially enter cellphone hardware industry.</p>

<ul>
<li>Snapdragon 821 CPU</li>
<li>4GB memory</li>
<li>12.3 million pixel camera</li>
<li>32GB/128GB storage</li>
</ul>
<p>And Google Pixel has 5-inch 1080P screen and 2770mAh battery; On the other hand Pixel XL has 5.5-inch 2K screen and 3450mAh battery. Both support fast charge, and Google marketing them for 15 minutes charging can use 7 hours.</p>
<p>On Google Store, the official price of Pixel was from <a href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_phone" target="_blank" rel="external">$649</a> with free shipping.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The long-awaited Nintendo Switch has been officially launched on Mar 2017, together with the more exciting new game “Zelda legend: the wilderness of interest”. Nintendo said Switch would combine the convenience of handheld consoles with the powerful features of TV consoles. Although in order to achieve the full integration of portability and functionality, Nintendo had made some compromises, people believe Switch can be achieved “one plus one greater than two” effect once more games released.</p>

<h2 id="Nintendo’s-Counterattack"><a href="#Nintendo’s-Counterattack" class="headerlink" title="Nintendo’s Counterattack"></a>Nintendo’s Counterattack</h2><p>Switch is perhaps Nintendo’s last straw. Today, Sony and Microsoft are the two most competitive companies in the field of TV game consoles. Nintendo never want to join the competition again after the Wii U’s waterloo. </p>
<p>In response to this situation, Nintendo put forward a very cohesive and very intelligent solution - Switch, although this program still has its short board. As a home TV console, Switch can directly compete with PlayStation 4 and Xbox One at some level. On the other hand, as a handheld device, it also outperform existing mobile systems and smartphones. Nintendo tried to please everyone, this is nothing more than a gamble, and the more you think about it, the more you think this may be the only gambling that Nintendo can do.</p>

<h2 id="So-What-is-Nintendo-Switch"><a href="#So-What-is-Nintendo-Switch" class="headerlink" title="So What is Nintendo Switch?"></a>So What is Nintendo Switch?</h2><p>The main body of Switch consists of a Kindle-sized tablet computer (Nintendo called “host”). It providing two game modes, when the host is connected to the TV through the Dock base, it is like a regular game console, two small wireless handles (called “Joy-Con R” and “Joy-Con L”) can be used independently or separately.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/MarkoCen/cheeper-images/44409e24/nintendo-switch-reviews/switch-1.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>When you want to go out, just take the host out of the Dock - the game will continue and display on the built-in screen immediately, it is not running through the cloud video stream, nor is it a lite mobile version - it is exactly the same game that runs on the same hardware, just the screen is different. You can put the handles on both sides of the tablet, turn it into a single device. Switch can also be connected wirelessly for up to 8 people to play the game together, although we have not had the opportunity to test this play.</p>
<div class="item-box"><img src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B01LTHP2ZK&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=cheeperio-20"><a class="title" href="http://amzn.to/2mZPnAR" target="_blank" rel="external">Nintendo Switch</a><a href="http://amzn.to/2mZPnAR" class="link-btn" target="_blank" rel="external">Buy it<br> on<br> Amazon.com</a></div>

<h2 id="Let’s-take-a-look-at-the-details"><a href="#Let’s-take-a-look-at-the-details" class="headerlink" title="Let’s take a look at the details"></a>Let’s take a look at the details</h2><p>Switch host itself is about 21 cm wide and 10 cm wide and 1.2 cm thick - the size is probably equivalent to Kindle or small tablet computer.  And then look at the handles, it is not unfounded that a lot of people compare the handles with the Wii U’s handles, but the difference is more like the difference between day and night. Wii U handle is like a children’s music toys. At the same time, Switch’s handle feels like a high-end smartphone: thin, well-done, very solid.</p>
<p>Many of the features we are familiar with are focused on the Switch edge: power, volume, cassette, Micro SD card slot, bottom speakers, and top cooling holes. Switch on both sides looks a bit rough, because it is precisely the two handles into the slide. The game is installed in the SD card inside, can be directly inserted into the upper right corner of the Switch. Read and load the game time is very fast, giving the impression of a blink of an eye to complete.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/MarkoCen/cheeper-images/6756d1d0/nintendo-switch-reviews/switch-2.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Switch can be inserted into the Dock base, switch to the host mode. Dock base is made of plastic, looks very light, Dock base also can be easily shaked, once accidentally twisted, Switch host will certainly fly out. To be honest, this thing is definitely not worth $90.</p>
<p>It is a pleasant experience to slide the Joy-Con handle on both sides of the flat panel. They can not only slide along the slide safely and accurately, and one end will be issued a crisp click, but also accompanied by the flat panel host bite together sound effects, the screen will show the handle has been installed in place. After the combination is complete, the entire host is very tight, there is no signs of loosening.</p>
<p>The battery life of Switch is depend on which game you are playing. In the maximum brightness, I played the “Legend of Zelda” about two and a half hours. Joy-Con handle battery life is up to 20 hours.</p>
<div class="item-box"><img src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B01LTHP2ZK&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=cheeperio-20"><a class="title" href="http://amzn.to/2mZPnAR" target="_blank" rel="external">Nintendo Switch</a><a href="http://amzn.to/2mZPnAR" class="link-btn" target="_blank" rel="external">Buy it<br> on<br> Amazon.com</a></div>

<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Nintendo has been successful in Switch design. Switch is well produced and easy to play. Now the problem is that the games running on Switch is not much. Personally, I not only hope that Switch will be a platform with a small number of independent brand games, but also become a suitable for lightweight independent games and innovative mobile cross-border game development platform. For a child, Switch is a good product for people who are often outside, as well as players who do not have time or do not want to sit down on the big screen to play games. Nintendo and its partners will be able to survive, Switch will eventually become a must-have game console, like Xbox, PlayStation, mobile phones, PC and other types of game equipment sold on the market.</p>

    <title>Best Affordable 4K Cameras in 2017</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We all know 4K era is coming, If you take a look at those cameras released in 2016, no surprise that all major camera manufacturers have implemented 4K shooting somewhere in their lines. </p>
<p>And most excitingly, in 2017, you would see this feature not only on high end cameras, but also on mid lower end. So, no matter how much budget you have, it’s likely you can afford a camera with 4K video in 2017.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>Although most of new released cameras came with 4K shooting feature, doesn’t mean to say they’re same. Actually 4K cameras could perform quick differently with different structures and configurations. Even something as simple as whether the camera uses the full width of the sensor is vital to consider, as this has a significant effect on your effective angle of view, not to mention other features we have to consider such as focus peaking, zebra patterning and log profiles.</p>
<p>In this post, we first gave a brief introduction on 4K video and 4K video camera, then, we’ve rounded up the top affordable 4K cameras on market right now, and list why they’ve stand out from the rest.</p>
<h2 id="What-Is-4K-Video"><a href="#What-Is-4K-Video" class="headerlink" title="What Is 4K Video?"></a>What Is 4K Video?</h2><p><img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/MarkoCen/cheeper-images/29f8d923/best-affordable-4k-cameras-in-2017/4k-video-sample.jpg" alt=""><br>A 4K video is a video with 4K resolution, refers to horizontal resolution on the order of 4,000 pixels and vertical resolution on the order of 2,000 pixels. </p>
<p>There are two main 4K resolution standards: The DCI 4K resolution standard, which has a resolution of 4096 × 2160 pixels (256:135, approximately a 1.9:1 aspect ratio). This standard is <a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/home-theater/everything-you-need-to-know-about-4k-ultra-hd/" target="_blank" rel="external">widely respected by the film and video production industry</a>. </p>
<p>The other one is called UHD-1, or ultra-high-definition television (UHDTV), is the 4K standard for television and computer monitors. Many manufacturers may advertise their products as UHD 4K, or simply 4K, when the term 4K is traditionally reserved for the cinematic, DCI resolution. This often causes great confusion among consumers.</p>
<h2 id="Do-I-Need-a-4K-Video-Camera"><a href="#Do-I-Need-a-4K-Video-Camera" class="headerlink" title="Do I Need a 4K Video Camera?"></a>Do I Need a 4K Video Camera?</h2><p>Although the jump from 1080p to 4K isn’t as obvious as SD to HD was, you still have many benefits if you use a 4K video camera. And the benefits of shooting in 4K will growth in the future as 4K video does become a norm.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Sharper 4K footage</strong><br>Nowadays, most HD cameras will shoot in 1080p (the highest level of HD footage) but there is no regulation at all on a camera’s bit-rate, some low end cameras typically output HD footage at a relatively low bit-rate. This causes your footage to look soft, pixelated, and even blurred. On the other side, a 4k video is approximately the size of 4 standard 1080p videos. Shrinking down 4k footage to be 1080p is a night and day difference in detail and quality. So, even you don’t have a 4K output equipment, shooting 4k video footage and down-sampling to get a sharper 1080p final export can also help cut down on noise and grain making the footage appear to be cleaner as well.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Perfect Pans and Zooms</strong><br>It’s almost impossible to film a perfectly smooth pan with a regular video camera, it’s also literally impossible to film a perfectly smooth zoom with a manual lens. However, If you shoot 4k, small pans and zooms have never been easier. Simply zoom out, grab a few seconds of your scene and then add a pan or a zoom once you get back to the computer. Adding these movements to your video in post will actually look better than anything you can do in the field and because 4k gives you so many extra pixels to work with, your finished product will look flawless.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Good For Cropping</strong><br>As videos are sets of still images, the same technical operations apply to them as well. If you want to re-crop your picture a higher resolution camera might be of help. You can do that on a 2K camera as well, although it will result in a less than 2K frame. Slightly upscaling a video won’t be much noticeable. Say, you cropped a 16:9 1920 pixels video to a 16:9 1800 pixels. Resizing it back to 1920 won’t be so bad as quality. For example “Whiplash” uses footage from ARRI Alexa (2.8K) and Canon 7D (HD) and the final content is delivered in 2K.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Visual Effects</strong><br>Bigger video frames can be useful for incorporating parts of them in visual effects. An example of that is the Queen of Hearts in the Alice movies. The way they made her head bigger is composing her head on top of the original footage. They used the same footage for the head, masking it out, but it was slightly enlarged. In order to deliver high quality footage in 2K they shot these in 4K. This way they did not have to upscale the head but resize the original footage slightly down and have the “head footage” in original resolution.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="How-to-choose-a-4K-camera"><a href="#How-to-choose-a-4K-camera" class="headerlink" title="How to choose a 4K camera"></a>How to choose a 4K camera</h2><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Digital-Backpack-Battery-Charger/dp/B015NBVKKE/ref=as_li_ss_il?s=photo&ie=UTF8&qid=1487757379&sr=1-1-spons&keywords=Sony+a7S&psc=1&linkCode=li3&tag=cheeperio-20&linkId=cde4d953adb3b087e935aa328fb96829" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B015NBVKKE&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=cheeperio-20"></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=cheeperio-20&l=li3&o=1&a=B015NBVKKE" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;"></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Mirrorless</strong><br>We recommend mirrorless cameras unless you are a keen photographer. Mirrorless cameras are one of the cheapest ways to buy a 4K camera. Generally priced between $500 – $1500, they take high quality pictures and 4K video recording is excellent.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>DSLR</strong><br>DSLR allows a camera with interchangeable lenses and a viewfinder, almost all professional sports, press and wildlife photographers choose full-frame DSLRs over every other camera type, not many DSLR cameras film in 4K, and even DSLR camera is much expensive than mirrorless camera.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Battery life</strong><br>Battery life is related important for a recording camera, there are many types of battery. Your digital camera might be using disposable batteries or maybe it uses rechargeable ones. When it comes to power consumption not all digital camera features are equal. Some of the digital camera greatest features are high energy consumers. The biggest energy consumers in a digital camera are the LCD screen and the motors that move the mechanical components of the camera such as the lenses when focusing or zooming. </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Recording media</strong><br>4K video (and high bit-rate HD) files are big, it could consume nearly 43GB of disk space for 1 hour of footage, Not only are these files sizable, they also require media capable of fast, continuous write speeds. Most manufacturers recommend <a href="http://amzn.to/2kKX5yp" target="_blank" rel="external">SDHC/XC cards with a UHS-I U3 rating</a>, U3 cards guarantee a minimum write speed of 30MB/s. Another major advantage of using fast media shows up on the back end. Bringing big files into the computer takes time. If your project has you shooting and backing up on site, read speeds are certainly a factor in choosing new memory cards.</p>

<p>By far, Sony Alpha A7S II is the best 4K video camera in the market. It already received tons of great feedbacks on internet, we highly recommend to choose this camera if you have enough budget, this camera won’t let you disappointed in any ways. The uncompressed 4K video resolution goes all the way up to 3840 x 2160 pixels and you also have some additional XLR audio inputs for external microphones to capture better quality audio. It also has the advantage of using the whole sensor width for recording video, and of being able to record to the memory card while outputting 4:2:2 footage to a HDMI recorder, but proves itself to be capable for stills shooting too.</p>
<div class="item-box"><img src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B0158SRJVQ&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=cheeperio-20"><a class="title" href="http://amzn.to/2lKYftx" target="_blank" rel="external">Sony Alpha A7S II</a><a href="http://amzn.to/2lKYftx" class="link-btn" target="_blank" rel="external">Check Price<br> on<br> Amazon.com</a></div>

<p>Built-in Wi-Fi connectivity enables the a7S II to instantly share imagery to mobile devices for direct sharing online to social networking, via email, and to cloud storage sites. NFC (Near Field Communication) is also supported, which allows for one-touch connection between the camera and compatible mobile devices; no complex set-up is required. Once connected, the linked mobile device can also display a live view image on its screen and remotely control the camera’s shutter.</p>

<p>Panasonic Lumix GH4 is a true hybrid camera designed for both professional photo and video use. it delivers video quality surpassing many professional video cameras. Video can be recorded in a variety of formats, from efficient AVCHD and AVCHD Progressive, to 200 Mbps All-Intra and 100 Mbps IPB MOV and MP4 formats. It has a 16 MP sensor, great low light support, and ISO up to 25600. The design isn’t necessarily as compact as others but it is still feasible for most applications that don’t involve running around with their camera.</p>

<p>Nikon 2016 flagship model certainly didn’t hold back with the specs, the capable of recording more than just stills, it supports 4K UHD video recording at 30, 25, and 24 fps frame rates and Full HD/HD recording at up to 60 fps, along with the ability to save movie files to the in-camera memory cards or as an uncompressed file to an optional external recorder via HDMI out. </p>
<div class="item-box"><img src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B01A7Q0J3Y&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=cheeperio-20"><a class="title" href="http://amzn.to/2m7ltum" target="_blank" rel="external">Nikon D500</a><a href="http://amzn.to/2m7ltum" class="link-btn" target="_blank" rel="external">Check Price<br> on<br> Amazon.com</a></div>

<p>As with still shooting, the wide range of sensitivities is available for recording in low- and bright-light conditions, ranging from expanded ISO 100-1640000, and sensitivity values are manually adjustable via the dedicated movie-shooting menu. Also, a video-optimized Flat Picture Control mode can be used during recording to flatten the overall contrast curve for more control during post-production and color grading. In addition to straight movie recording, time-lapse recording, for up to 9999 consecutive frames shot over the course of up to one week, is also possible with up to 4K UHD/30p output from the camera.</p>

<p>You must heard of GoPro and their domination in the sports and action video camera market, but did you know their high end models can shoot in 4K video? This new released HERO5 Black can record in UHD 4K resolution up to 30fps or switch to lower resolutions such as 1080p and 720p for access to higher frame rates, more FOV (Field Of View) options, and electronic stabilization. </p>
<div class="item-box"><img src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B01MT0TJOM&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=cheeperio-20"><a class="title" href="http://amzn.to/2l7MI43" target="_blank" rel="external">GoPro HERO 5 Black</a><a href="http://amzn.to/2l7MI43" class="link-btn" target="_blank" rel="external">Check Price<br> on<br> Amazon.com</a></div>

<p>Audio for video is recorded using three microphones. In normal conditions, the HERO5 Black will process the audio for a stereo signal. If high winds start affecting the audio, the HERO5 Black can intuit which microphone is picking up the best sound and automatically switch to that microphone in real-time and filter out any excess wind noise</p>
<p>It also come with a photo mode, In addition to standard JPEG capture, the HERO5 Black can also capture raw images in the .GPR format which can be processed for high quality output.</p>

      &lt;p&gt;We all know 4K era is coming, If you take a look at those cameras released in 2016, no surprise that all major camera manufacturers have implemented 4K shooting somewhere in their lines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And most excitingly, in 2017, you would see this feature not only on high end cameras, but also on mid lower end. So, no matter how much budget you have, it’s likely you can afford a camera with 4K video in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>PS4 Pro just out for couple of months and we are already hearing rumors on Sony next generation console - PlayStation 5. Up to date, there is no official announcement about PS5’s release and specs, but there is one thing we could expect that its power would be formidable compared to other console systems. Who knows, it might surpass <a href="/blog/2017/Xbox-Scorpio-The-Next-Generation-Game-Console/">Microsoft’s Project Scorpio</a> as well.</p>

<h2 id="VR-compatibility-with-4K-resolution"><a href="#VR-compatibility-with-4K-resolution" class="headerlink" title="VR compatibility with 4K resolution"></a>VR compatibility with 4K resolution</h2><p><img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/MarkoCen/cheeper-images/3f64a437/playstation-vr.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Sony released PlayStation VR and became the first console manufacturer embracing VR technology, of course, PlayStation VR is competing with the <a href="http://amzn.to/2lDXa3W" target="_blank" rel="external">Oculus Rift</a> and the <a href="http://amzn.to/2l6WTIZ" target="_blank" rel="external">HTC Vive</a>, and it’s cheaper with less resolution and frame rates, but the frame rates would be improved if it running on a PS4 Pro. This proved that Sony has jumped on board of virtual reality. So it’s a good bet that, Sony would like to return to the VR market with a higher-end VR equipment(maybe called PlayStation VR 2?) with PS5, and we have enough reasons to believe PS5 would take VR gaming experience to a next level.</p>
<p>We all know VR is the future, but 4k is the present. No matter Xbox One S or PlayStation 4 Pro, both are 4K compatible, and PS5 would support playing games in native 4K. Mark Cerny is the lead architect on the PS4 and the PS4 Pro, in an interview with the Japanese site AV Watch, Cerny was talking about the PS4 Pro and the argument surrounding 4K, he said that the image reaches resolutions are “extremely close to 4K”, this leads us to believe that the new system will most certainly run games at 4K. Mark’s comments also give us a potential window into the PS5, he believes that 4K is only achievable with 8 teraflops of power, then it’s safe to assume he’s going to shoot for this when he’s designing the PS5.</p>

<h2 id="A-Cloud-Based-Gaming-Platform"><a href="#A-Cloud-Based-Gaming-Platform" class="headerlink" title="A Cloud-Based Gaming Platform?"></a>A Cloud-Based Gaming Platform?</h2><p><img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/MarkoCen/cheeper-images/95419585/playstation-now-logo.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Recently, Masayasu Ito, Sony executive vice president, shared his thoughts on the PS5 with the online edition of the Japanese publication Nikkei:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think there will be a PS5. However, I don’t know what form it’ll have. It could be a physical console, or it could be in the cloud. But even if the form might change, PS5 Games will be born. This is what we want.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This year, Sony has made the first step to cloud gaming services with the release of <a href="https://www.playstation.com/ps-now" target="_blank" rel="external">PlayStation Now</a> and the PlayStation TV console. However, all exsiting services haven’t exactly taken off, Sony likes the idea of a streaming game service, but mostly the gradual introduction of new hardware like PlayStation VR and new services like PlayStation Now gives them the opportunity to test the waters. Once Sony has all the results, they would make a final desicion on PS5’s form. </p>

<p>There is another exciting concept - DualShock 5 Controller, people guessing Dualshock 5 will be on the ultimate ergonomic controller experience, the touchpad is switched out for a touchscreen which could able to display everything from radar, to health, to other creative concepts. Also wireless charging would be intergrated with PS5 controller, with wireless charging, gamers can quickly and easily recharge the controller when it gets low. Additional features we can expect would be inspired by Xbox controllers that have a lot of customization options. For example, the sensitivity of the buttons will be adjustable in PS5 apps.</p>

<h2 id="Releasing-in-2018"><a href="#Releasing-in-2018" class="headerlink" title="Releasing in 2018?"></a>Releasing in 2018?</h2><p>In an interview with The Verge, Shawn Layden, head of SIEA and the PlayStation Worldwide Studios Group said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Right now we were concentrating on how do we iterate within this PS4 life cycle. The technology and improvements behind PS4 Plus are our way of articulating where we think the market wants to go. People will want to have greater fidelity of images and graphics. Where we go from there, we’re going to have to wait and see. It’s our first time innovating within the life cycle, so I’m not exactly sure what impact that will have on our plan going forward. <strong>But there will be more PlayStations</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, Andrew House, the CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment said in E3 2016:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>I’m not suggesting we want to bring the games industry to an 18-month-two-year cycle</strong> because then you would lose an awful lot of the fixed platform benefits we’ve enjoyed that allow for these really great leaps in game experience.</p>
<p>However, we did think there was an opportunity to reflect on the traditional lifecycle, and on 4K technology, and say maybe there’s an opportunity, within the course of a normal lifecycle to offer something else. Something a little bit better, for a segment of the market that feels that this is important.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Numerous rumors said PS5 would be announced on 2018, one of the famous prediction came from Damian Thong who accurately predicting the PS4 Pro and Slim released:</p>
<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">PS4 Pro? Wait, what about PS5? Macquarie&#39;s Damian Thong who correctly predicted PS4 slim and Pro says PS5 may arrive in 2nd half of 2018.</p>&mdash; Takashi Mochizuki (@mochi_wsj) <a href="https://twitter.com/mochi_wsj/status/773880640953475073" target="_blank" rel="external">September 8, 2016</a></blockquote></p>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>PS4 Pro released in 2016, and based on above comments, it’s fair to say we won’t see the PS5 in 2017, but we can expect PS5 will be the generational leap console we’re looking for</p>

    <updated>2017-02-10T14:44:50.333Z</updated>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Now we are officially entered in 2017, The speed of mobile phone replacement become faster and faster, what phones we could expect in 2017? Let’s see the five most anticipated phones in 2017, which one is better, which one is more suitable for you? Hope this article could help you to make a decision.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<h4 id="Apple-iPhone-8-8S"><a href="#Apple-iPhone-8-8S" class="headerlink" title="Apple iPhone 8/8S"></a><strong>Apple iPhone 8/8S</strong></h4><p><img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/MarkoCen/cheeper-images/12617373/apple-iphone-8.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The year of 2017 is the ten anniversary of Apple’s iPhone, the outside world agreed that Apple will make the largest upgrading for iPhone in its history. The next version of iPhone may be called <a href="http://amzn.to/2jiMHIJ" target="_blank" rel="external">iPhone 8/8s</a>, but it is also possible to use a new version name. the upgrade may include the use of new glass shell appearance, AMOLED hyperboloid screen, wireless charging, super dual camera and so on. There is a little chance that Apple may also release <a href="http://amzn.to/2jVaXTd" target="_blank" rel="external">iPhone 7S</a> in 2017, but based on past experiences, Apple won’t release two flagship phones at same year.</p>
<h4 id="Samsung-Galaxy-S8-S8-Edge-Note-8"><a href="#Samsung-Galaxy-S8-S8-Edge-Note-8" class="headerlink" title="Samsung Galaxy S8/S8 Edge/Note 8"></a><strong>Samsung Galaxy S8/S8 Edge/Note 8</strong></h4><p><img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/MarkoCen/cheeper-images/12617373/galaxy-s8.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The era of smartphone technology creators have long been more than just Apple, Samsung’s hyperbolic screen is the most successful invention in 2016, at the same time, Samsung is also taking the lead of camera technology in the entire smartphone industry. </p>
<p>Due to the current Samsung phones still not use dual camera, and the industry which either Apple or various international and domestic manufacturers have taken the dual camera, so it is worth to look forward the <a href="http://amzn.to/2k4I20Q" target="_blank" rel="external">new Galaxy phones</a> integrate dual camera, in addition, because of the obvious problems of <a href="http://amzn.to/2jtotyy" target="_blank" rel="external">Note 7</a>, the S Pen and iris recognition features has also been delayed, and those features may add into the new Note 8.</p>
<h4 id="Huawei-P10-Mate-10"><a href="#Huawei-P10-Mate-10" class="headerlink" title="Huawei P10/Mate 10"></a><strong>Huawei P10/Mate 10</strong></h4><p><img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/MarkoCen/cheeper-images/12617373/huawei-10.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>2016 is a successful year for <a href="http://amzn.to/2k7ldu2" target="_blank" rel="external">Huawei P9</a> and <a href="http://amzn.to/2jUZLWx" target="_blank" rel="external">Mate 9</a>, the best selling point is Leica’s dual camera.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://amzn.to/2ks4n9Q" target="_blank" rel="external">Dell XPS 15</a> and the <a href="http://amzn.to/2k2GrZP" target="_blank" rel="external">MacBook Pro</a> are both excellent computers. It often is said that the two are so close in terms of quality that it’s difficult to say which is better. However, they each have their own benefits and drawbacks.</p>

<h4 id="Pros-Of-The-MacBook-Pro"><a href="#Pros-Of-The-MacBook-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Pros Of The MacBook Pro"></a><strong>Pros Of The MacBook Pro</strong></h4><ul>
<li><p>MacBook Pro Security: The MacBook Pro uses a Mac Sierra operating system, which tends to be more secure than the Windows 10 used by the Dell XPS15. While macintosh operating systems are not completely immune to malware, they are far more malware resistant than Windows. </p>
</li>
<li><p>The MacBook Pro’s Built In Voice Assistant: The MacBook Pro comes with Siri. While the Dell XPS15 offers Cortana, Siri is much more reliable. Additionally, Siri does not track your voice search history like Cortana. Your voice searches with Siri aren’t saved with your IP address, name, or any personally identifying information. </p>
</li>
<li><p>The Touch Screen: The MacBook Pro touch screen is one of the best on the market. Many have said that the experience of using the MacBook Pro is like combining an iPhone with a laptop. Despite there being a touchscreen, there also is a quality keyboard to use. While it’s possible to get a touchscreen on a Dell XPS 15, the MacBook Pro is of better quality. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Cons-Of-The-MacBook-Pro"><a href="#Cons-Of-The-MacBook-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Cons Of The MacBook Pro"></a><strong>Cons Of The MacBook Pro</strong></h4><ul>
<li><p>Less Ports: The MacBook Pro doesn’t have anywhere near the number of ports as the Dell XPS 15. This means that it’s not as easy to connect other devices to it. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Price: The MacBook Pro will cost you at least $1499 from Apple. If you get the touchscreen, the price rises to $1999. You could <a href="https://cheeper.io">check &amp; compare Macbook Pro prices here</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A Small Number Of Games Available: There are relatively few games run on a Mac Sierra operating system. While there are some, you’re likely to have a much harder time finding a game that you like.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dell-XPS9560-5000SLV-PUS-15-6-Inch-Traditional-Laptop/dp/B01N2RLP5M/ref=as_li_ss_il?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1485347011&sr=1-3&keywords=dell+xps+15&linkCode=li3&tag=cheeperio-20&linkId=9f62654180079b416aa58503d36e1a58" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B01N2RLP5M&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=cheeperio-20"></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=cheeperio-20&l=li3&o=1&a=B01N2RLP5M" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;"></p>
<h4 id="Pros-Of-Dell-XPS-15"><a href="#Pros-Of-Dell-XPS-15" class="headerlink" title="Pros Of Dell XPS 15"></a><strong>Pros Of Dell XPS 15</strong></h4><ul>
<li><p>Quality Gaming Experience: If you’re a fan of PC games, you’ll definitely want a Windows operating system. The Dell XPS 15 comes with Windows 10. This operating system will allow you to play an exceptionally wide range of games, and you’ll be able to stream games from your <a href="http://amzn.to/2jedkON" target="_blank" rel="external">Xbox One</a> or <a href="http://amzn.to/2ksgrI1" target="_blank" rel="external">PlayStation 4</a> to your laptop! There are even some Windows 10 games available for free. </p>
</li>
<li><p>It’s Environmentally Friendly: The Dell XPS 15 is particularly environmentally friendly. Many computers have toxic metals inside them, but the Dell XPS 15 is designed without mercury and other toxic metals.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Battery Life: The Dell XPS 15 potentially can have a somewhat longer battery life than the MacBook Pro. The MacBook Pro has a battery that holds 49.2 watt hours, but the Dell XPS 15 has a battery that holds 60 watt hours. The difference is not that large, but it can make a difference. However, this advantage is eliminated if you get the Dell XPS 15 with a touchscreen. If you get a touchscreen, the battery tends not to last as long as the MacBook Pro. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Higher Resolution: The Dell XPS 15 features excellent graphics. In fact, the resolution on the Dell XPS 15 is 3200 x 1800 pixels as opposed to the MacBook Pro’s 2,560 x 1,600 pixels. It even is possible to pay extra to get the Dell XPS 15 with QHD+. This will result in even better graphics </p>
</li>
<li><p>More Advanced Processor: The processor on the Dell XPS 15 uses a 7th Generation Intel Core processor. However, the MacBook Pro runs on a 6th Generation Intel Core Processor. </p>
</li>
<li><p>High Resolution Webcam: The Dell XPS 15 has a higher resolution webcam than the MacBook Pro. The webcam on the Dell XPS 15 has a resolution of 720p. This is far more than the MacBook Pro’s webcam resolution of 480p. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Cons-Of-The-Dell-XPS-15"><a href="#Cons-Of-The-Dell-XPS-15" class="headerlink" title="Cons Of The Dell XPS 15"></a><strong>Cons Of The Dell XPS 15</strong></h4><ul>
<li><p>Inaccurate Colors On The Webcam: The Dell XPS 15 webcam doesn’t show colors as they are. Instead, the colors tend to be a bit over-saturated.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Lower Quality Audio: While the graphics on the Dell XPS 15 are excellent, the audio isn’t anywhere near this level of quality. However, the MacBook Pro offers higher quality audio. If you listen to music a lot, this can be a reason to choose the MacBook Pro over the Dell XPS 15. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Lower Hard Drive Speed: Copying and moving files can take longer with the Dell XPS 15 than the MacBook Pro. The hard drive tends to run substantially slower. On the MacBook Pro, the hard drive speed averages 355.9 mb/s. However, the hard drive on the Dell XPS 15 averages at just 231.33 mb/s. This figure is even slower if you use a Dell XPS 15 with a touchscreen.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For many cell phone enthusiasts, Nexus phone has been a belief-like existence: high perfomance with low-cost, authentic Android experience, all of these make Nexus a must-have phone in Android’s world. </p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>However, all this eventually become memories - Google decided <a href="http://www.androidcentral.com/end-nexus-2016-google-phones-forge-new-path" target="_blank" rel="external">end the Nexus series on 2016</a>, and created new signature series and named it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Pixel" target="_blank" rel="external">Pixel</a>.</p>
<p>Prior to the Nexus phone has been the foundry to provide design solutions, Google is responsible for changes and additions, so we can find the Nexus phone on behalf of the various foundries.<br>This year’s Pixel mobile phone designed entirely by Google itself, on behalf of the industry is only responsible for the production and assembly of HTC, which is very similar to the relationship between Apple and Foxconn. This time you can only find one capital “G” on the back of pixel phone, and no traces of the foundry, which also marks Google officially enter cellphone hardware industry.</p>
<p>Pixel / Pixel XL are equipped with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Snapdragon 821 CPU</li>
<li>4GB memory</li>
<li>12.3 million pixel camera</li>
<li>32GB/128GB storage</li>
</ul>
<p>And Google Pixel has 5-inch 1080P screen and 2770mAh battery; On the other hand Pixel XL has 5.5-inch 2K screen and 3450mAh battery. Both support fast charge, and Google marketing them for 15 minutes charging can use 7 hours.</p>
<p>On Google Store, the official price of Pixel was from <a href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_phone" target="_blank" rel="external">$649</a> with free shipping. On Amazon, the price was from <a href="http://amzn.to/2ju2GFs" target="_blank" rel="external">$550</a>, and you could check a full <a href="https://cheeper.io/?q=google-pixel&amp;c=wireless">price comparison list</a> on our website</p>
